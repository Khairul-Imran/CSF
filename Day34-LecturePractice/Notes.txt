Observable -> from Rxjs library
Allows you to write asynchronous code -> make asynchronous calls?

Differences between Observable and Promises
Promises -> 
- allows a single value (call). Not lazy loading. You create a promise that will make a call to retrieve data (not lazy), async
No function support
Child handles the error
- There is no sub/ unsub -> cannot be cancelled -> Need to wait for it to finish fully

Observable 
-> allows multiple values. Lazy loading (can be subscribed to), asynch,sync support
Support various functions
Error depends whether it is fulfilled or not.
Different status:
- pending
- success/resolved
- failure / rejected
- complete
- There is subscribe and unsubscribe -> can cancel the request once you got what you want


---------------------------Started On Lecture Example---------------------------

Installed Angular Material
Installed json-server -> simulates an api locally in your device? (json-server not tested, assessment you need your own api)

- Created the db.json file, to populate with employees (used by json-server)

Imported the necessary Material-related stuff (copied from previous practice)

- Created the service class with the command
- Added the necessary methods for employees


Then we created a new employee list component
- He wanted to implement pagination using material, so we did that. (in the html)
- He went through the sample html code from material's documentation.


- Missed out something in the code. See his example.


---------------------------Started On OpenWeather, and News API Example---------------------------

- Logged into my OpenWeatherApp account.
- Logged into NewsApi Account.

- He went through how to work with JSON the data you get from the api
