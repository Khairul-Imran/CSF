Deleted:
App component spec
app routing module

Remove the unnecessary stuff inside app.module.ts
app.component.html -> delete everything.
    - insert some simple html to see if it is working.

-----------------------------------------------New Section-----------------------------------------------

Create a number component
- Up and down buttons to increase/decrease the number
- button to console.info the number

Additional:
- Checkbox -> to make console.info to output a -ve number

Extend:
Take the number component, and put two numbers side by side

- Managed to extend it so that we can calculate the result of the 2 numbers. Didn't fully implement the negative calculations, because too much to do.

He explained some stuff here
model view view presenter

- each component is like an mvc

*****
Input - from the parent into the child (use attribute binding to pass the value in) -> []

Whatever happens in the child, the parent can't see.

To allow the parent to see, need to pass in a function - "When this event happens, tell the parent" -> (eventName) -> @Output
When this event happens, call this function

See the app.component.html for an example
