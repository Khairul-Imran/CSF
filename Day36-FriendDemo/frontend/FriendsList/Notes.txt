In his spring boot service, he is using a read-write lock.
-> only needed in this case, when you're not using a database.
-> if I am reading, everyone can read.
-> If I am writing, the read lock has to wait for me to finish writing

write -> exclusive
read -> shared

Try to dockerise this whole app (front and backend)
- compile the frontend -> copy them to the static folder in your SB
- Need 3 stage dockerisation 
    first to build angular
    second to copy the built angular one to the static folder 
    third deploy?
    - The 2nd and 3rd step has been done before in previous deployments.
    - Just need to add the first part at the top of the dockerfile

Using @Input and @Output vs Using services
-> @Input and output requires more documentation -> allows you to understand more about the structure
-> Services -> less documentation -> need to read more code to know what is happening.
