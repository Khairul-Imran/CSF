We have the todo data
- Now we need to pass that data to the parent,
- And clear the form.


Lecture Task

Name
Email
Phone
DOB
Friend checkbox
Add button -> Adds friend to the list of friends on the right
Update Button -> Updates friend info.

When you click on the names on the right, it will repopulate the data in the form on the left.

Create an object model to hold this information.
- to make it harder, can add hobbies (array) -> similar to tasks

You don't really need the submit event to precess the form.
One of the fields should be like a primary key (cannot be edited?)
