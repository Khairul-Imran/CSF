- Import onInit, and implement its method.

- create friendsForm variable

- create createFriendsForm method.
- Initialise the friends form inside your onInit
- Bind it in your html
    - [formGroup]
    - formControlName

- put the [disabled] in your form buttons

- did the create() method -> reading directly from you friendsForm

- Did the newFriend method

- Started on the app component.ts' methods
- Started on the app component html

- He had a friends-list component, worked on that.
- Notice the arrays are the same between the app and friends-list
- So he is just passing the index, no need to worry that the arrays are changing.

- He showed onChanges

He showed:
- If it is a new entry, mute update
- If it is an existing entry, should mute add
(updateMode, cannotCreate(), cannotUpdate())

- Will redo this.
