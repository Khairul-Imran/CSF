First he showed how to use @ViewChild
- We used View child to manipulate text in the child from our parent



After Tea break:
- For making your angular app progressive
- ng add @angular/pwa

There are new files inside the directory -> 
- ngsw-config.json, 
- manifest.webmanifest, 
- angular.json, 
- package.json

- index.html is changed automatically to include the manifest.
- app.module also now includes your sericeWorkerModule

to generate you distribution folder
- ng build
- Has everything needed to run your app.

To install the http-server:
- npm i -g http-server

To run your web server
- http-server -p 8080 -c-1 dist/day33-lecture-demo/browser
- -c-1 disables the caching

- Use the second ip address to access it on your phone.

Install bootstrap into your angular app
- npm install bootstrap
- Need to import in your css file too
    - @import "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css"


After lunch:
- Install angular material
- ng add @angular/material

Also need hammerjs and animations (along with material)
- ng add hammerjs
- ng add @angular/animations


- Create a new material module
- ng g m Material
- This creates a material-module folder that contains your module.

- For whatever field/features you wanna use, need to import the specific module.
- You will import several modules from material into this module that you just created. (into the imports/exports section)
    - MatFormFieldModule
    - MatInputModule
    - MatIconModule
    - ....
    - (Need to know what to import, need do manually. No auto complete.) -> To make this easier, you can go to the angular material documentation, to the specific components you want to use, and copy the import statement from there.
    - (Whatever you import, need to export too) -> Exposes your imports to the rest of the app
    - (remember to import it in your main app module too.)

- You need to then export the contents in this module to the rest of your app.

To add on to the practice, Darryl went through a friend form example, and added the material stuff.



He seemed to hint at practicing dates and drop down related stuff?



REMEMBER TO IMPORT THE REACTIVE FORMS MODULE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!INTO THE APP.MODULE
ALSO JUST USE DEEP PURPLE
